## **Directory Structure**

### **Codes:**

- **requirements.txt**: Contains the dependencies required for running the Streamlit app, including libraries such as Streamlit and other necessary Python packages.
- **Streamlit_app.py**: The main Python script for the Streamlit web application, which loads the Iris dataset and provides interactive features for data visualization.
- **Iris_Dataset_Analysis.py**: A Python script for analyzing the Iris dataset. This file contains the core data analysis logic, including any data preprocessing and visualization steps.

### **Documentation Files:**

- **Agile_Sprint_Planning.md**: This markdown file contains the documentation for the sprint planning of the project. It outlines the development process, tasks completed, and the project timeline.
- **Agile_Sprint_Planning.pdf**: A PDF document that includes all output from the project, including results from the analysis and application features, formatted for easy sharing and printing.

---

## **Installation and Usage**

To run the Streamlit app, you need to install the required dependencies. You can install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Usage**

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Streamlit app by running:

```bash
streamlit run Streamlit_app.py
```

This will launch the application in your default web browser, where you can interact with the dataset and explore different visualizations.

## **Steps in the Project**

### **1. Project Overview: Agile Sprint Planning**

#### **Goal:**

- Conduct a simulated sprint planning session using Agile principles.
- Break down user stories into tasks, estimate their effort, and allocate them among team members (Alice, Bob, Charlie).
- Visualize and analyze sprint data using Streamlit.

---

### **2. Example Agile Sprint Planning Workflow**

**User Stories Example:**

Dataset and sprint task list tailored specifically to the described project, focusing on tasks like data collection, pipeline creation, deployment, and bug fixing.

---

### **Dataset Example for Agile Sprint Planning**

| Story ID | Description                                       | Priority | Effort | Assigned To |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1        | Collect dataset and clean for processing.         | Medium   | 4      | Alice       |
| 2        | Create a pipeline for visualizing sprint data.    | High     | 6      | Bob         |
| 3        | Deploy Streamlit app to cloud hosting.            | High     | 8      | Charlie     |
| 4        | Fix app crash caused by missing input validation. | High     | 9      | Alice       |
| 5        | Implement effort estimation slider for tasks.     | Medium   | 5      | Bob         |
| 6        | Add team assignment logic for user stories.       | Low      | 3      | Charlie     |

---

### **Steps for Task Breakdown and Assignment**

1. **Task Identification**: Break the project into actionable tasks (e.g., collect data, fix bugs, deploy app).
2. **Effort Estimation**: Use points to estimate the effort needed for each task (1 = low, 10 = high).
3. **Prioritization**: Assign priority levels (High, Medium, Low) based on project needs.
4. **Team Assignment**: Allocate tasks evenly among team members to balance workload.

### **Generated Sprint Plan**

| **Task**                            | **Points (Effort)** | **Priority** | **Assigned To** |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| Data collection and preprocessing   | 4                   | Medium       | Alice           |
| Build sprint visualization pipeline | 6                   | High         | Bob             |
| Deploy app to Streamlit cloud       | 8                   | High         | Charlie         |
| Fix crash on invalid user input     | 9                   | High         | Alice           |
| Add effort slider for estimation    | 5                   | Medium       | Bob             |
| Add team assignment functionality   | 3                   | Low          | Charlie         |

---

### **Sprint Summary**

- **Total Effort**: 35 points.
- **Average Effort per Team Member**:
  - Alice: 13 points.
  - Bob: 11 points.
  - Charlie: 11 points.

---

### **Effort Distribution Visualization**

- A bar chart showing points distributed across Alice, Bob, and Charlie.
- Ensures balance and highlights potential overloads.

This setup uses Agile principles to organize, estimate, and allocate tasks efficiently, making the project manageable and transparent.

---

### **4. Code for Agile Sprint Planning Simulation**

The integration of the Agile Sprint Planning and dataset visualization in Streamlit includes:

1. **Effort Estimation**: 
   - Use the **slider** widget to estimate effort for each user story (range: 1â€“10). Effort is based on complexity and priority.
   
2. **Task Allocation**: 
   - Assign stories to team members using the **dropdown menu**. The system ensures that tasks are distributed evenly among Alice, Bob, and Charlie.

3. **Visualization**:
   - **Bar chart** showing effort distribution among team members, helping to identify if workloads are balanced.

| **Step**                  | **Code/Action**                                                                          | **Output**                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Console Analysis**      | Simple Python script to analyze Iris dataset with `pandas` and visualize with `seaborn`. | Dataset overview, summary statistics, pair plot |
| **Streamlit Integration** | Modified script to display dataset, stats, and plot interactively in Streamlit.          | Interactive Streamlit app                       |
